***

Currently an entirely new design is being developed so if you would like to see that switch to the beta branch. If you want to see the one that is currently live you can stay on main.

Also please note if you are trying to host the file on your own server none of the images will load because they are all on The Maddox Networks domain. If you would like the images to appear add the following code to the head in the html. `<base href="https://themaddoxnetwork.com/">`

*Disclaimer: This repository does not contain code for the actual games, only the main page where you select a game and the page where you play the games on.*
